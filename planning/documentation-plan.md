# Documentation Plan
## Star Citizen Inventory Management System

This document outlines the comprehensive documentation requirements and maintenance schedule for the project.

## Documentation Philosophy

**Documentation is code.** It should be:
- Written alongside features (not after)
- Reviewed and updated with code changes
- Tested for accuracy (code examples should work)
- Accessible to all audiences (users, developers, operators)
