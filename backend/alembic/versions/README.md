# Alembic Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

**Do not edit migration files manually** unless absolutely necessary. If you need to modify a migration, create a new one instead.

## Naming Convention

Migrations are automatically named with:
- Revision ID (hash)
- Descriptive message

Example: `001_initial_schema.py`

## Running Migrations

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Rollback to specific revision
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# View migration history
alembic history

# Show current revision
alembic current
```
